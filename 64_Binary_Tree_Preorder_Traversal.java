-- if we have hierarchical data then we use tree data structure.
--when a node that do not have parent node is called as "root node" .
  # The root node is the topmost node in a tree data structure.
  # serving as the starting point from which all other nodes descend.
  # It has no parent and is the only node without a predecessor
  # In binary tree root node have two childes :
                             1.left node (left child)
                             2. right node (right child)
  # in Binary tree parent node have atmost "two" children not more than "two children" it can be less than "two" but not more than "two".
-- Preorder 
         types of traversal :
                1. Breadth first
                      # here we traverse tree horizontally.
                      # it is also known as "level" traversal.
                2. Depth First 
                      # here we traverse tree vertically .
                      # from top to bottom or vice versa .
                      # types of depth first traversal are:
                           1.preorder traversal (root----->left------>right)
                           2 .postorder traversal(left--------->right-------->root)
                           3. inorder traversal (left-------->root---------->right)
